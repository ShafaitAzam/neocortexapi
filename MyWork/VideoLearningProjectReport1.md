# Investigating the Existing Video Learning Project With NeocortexAPI:

## Workflow of the VideoLearning Project:

The overall project can be found in the [Project Folder](https://github.com/ddobric/neocortexapi/tree/SequenceLearning_ToanTruong/Project12_HTMCLAVideoLearning/HTMVideoLearning). This project contemplates the existing Sequence Learning procedure in [SequenceLearning.cs](https://github.com/ddobric/neocortexapi/tree/master/source/Samples/NeoCortexApiSample). WIth the help of python libraries the input training sets have been generated. [DataGeneration](https://github.com/ddobric/neocortexapi/tree/SequenceLearning_ToanTruong/DataGeneration). Three videos have been created with moving circle, triangle and rectangle. The program tries to read videos as input and for that a library has been created using OpenCV2. To run the project in the C# platform this [VideoLibrary](https://github.com/ddobric/neocortexapi/tree/SequenceLearning_ToanTruong/Project12_HTMCLAVideoLearning/HTMVideoLearning/VideoLibrary) needed some nuget packages named [Emgu.CV](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Emgu.CV/), [Emgu.CV.Bitmap](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Emgu.CV.Bitmap/) and [Emgu.CV.runtimes.windows](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Emgu.CV.runtime.windows/) with version higher than 4.5.3. The project reads input videos defined in the path and convert each videos into sequence of bit arrays. These bit arrays then pushed to the Spatial pooler where the learning stage begins. Homeostatic Plasticity Controller is connected with the SP so that it can reach to the stable state without forgetting. Afterwards the Temporal memory is introduced and the learning procedure is continued with SP and TM. The testing section has also been added where prediction is done from an input frame and the corresponding video has been generated depending on the correct prediction.
